## 🚀 Quick Start

### Local Development
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/study-guide-review.git
cd study-guide-review

# Install Jekyll dependencies
cd docs
bundle install

# Start local server
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

### Generate Combined Versions
```bash
# Generate both printable and web versions
make generate

# Or use the Python script directly
python3 scripts/generate_versions.py

# Generate specific versions
make print      # Printable version only
make web        # GitHub Pages version only
make pdf        # PDF version (requires pandoc)
make deploy     # Deploy complete version to docs/

# View available commands
make help
```

### GitHub Pages Deployment
The site automatically deploys to GitHub Pages when you push to the main branch. The GitHub Actions workflow handles:
- Building the Jekyll site
- Running tests
- Deploying to GitHub Pages

## 📖 Study Paths

### DevOps Engineer Track
1. **Core Data Structures** → **CI/CD & Infrastructure** → **Reliability Engineering** → **Security & Compliance**

### Backend Engineer Track
1. **Algorithms & Data Structures** → **System Design Problems** → **Data Layer** → **Performance Testing** → **Security Patterns**

### Full-Stack Developer Track
1. **Core Data Structures & Algorithms** → **System Design** → **DevOps Practices** → **Reliability Engineering** → **Security & Compliance**

## 🎯 Interview Preparation

### System Design Interviews
- Practice with the 12 classic problems in [System Design Problems](docs/system_design.md)
- Reference [Data Layer](docs/data_layer.md) for database decisions
- Use [Cheat Sheet](docs/cheat_sheet.md) for quick patterns and formulas

### Coding Interviews
- Master algorithms in [Algorithms](docs/algo.md) with practical examples
- Review data structure implementations in [Core Data Structures](docs/Core_Data_Structures.md)
- Practice searching and sorting in [Search & Sort](docs/search.md)

### DevOps Interviews
- Demonstrate practical knowledge with [CI/CD examples](docs/cicd.md)
- Show understanding of [Reliability Engineering](docs/reliability.md) including chaos engineering and observability
- Discuss load testing, monitoring, and resilience strategies

## 🖨️ Print-Friendly Format

All documents are formatted without emojis and optimized for:
- **Printing** - Clean, readable format for offline study
- **PDF Generation** - Easy conversion for digital distribution
- **Mobile Reading** - Responsive design for all devices

### Combined Versions
- **Complete Study Guide** - All content in one document for easy printing
- **Automatic Generation** - Scripts to combine all sections automatically
- **Multiple Formats** - Markdown, PDF, and web-optimized versions

## 🔧 Customization

### Adding New Content
1. Create new `.md` files in the `docs/` directory
2. Use the standard front matter format:
   ```yaml
   ---
   title: Your Title
   ---
   ```
3. Update the navigation in `docs/_config.yml`
4. Add links to the main index in `docs/index.md`

### Modifying the Theme
- Edit `docs/_config.yml` for theme settings
- Customize CSS in `docs/assets/css/`
- Modify layouts in `docs/_layouts/`
