## 1. Key Theoretical Foundations

### **CAP Theorem**

- A distributed database can only guarantee **two** out of three:

  - **Consistency (C):** every read returns the latest write.
  - **Availability (A):** every request receives a response (even if not the latest).
  - **Partition Tolerance (P):** system continues despite dropped/delayed messages.

**Tradeoffs:**

- **CP (Consistency + Partition Tolerance):** strict correctness, lower availability â†’ banking, financial systems.
- **AP (Availability + Partition Tolerance):** eventual consistency, high availability â†’ social media, caching layers.
- **CA (Consistency + Availability):** only realistic in single-node or non-partitioned systems.

---

### **ACID Transactions**

- **Atomicity** â†’ All or nothing (no partial writes).
- **Consistency** â†’ Data moves from one valid state to another.
- **Isolation** â†’ Transactions donâ€™t interfere with each other.
- **Durability** â†’ Committed changes survive crashes.

**Example (Bank Transfer):**

```
begin transaction
    debit Alice $100
    credit Bob $100
commit
```

If the system crashes mid-way, rollback ensures no partial transfer.

---

### **BASE Model** (common in NoSQL)

- **Basically Available:** system guarantees availability.
- **Soft state:** data may change over time (due to eventual consistency).
- **Eventual consistency:** if no updates occur, replicas converge.

## 2. Database Types & Design Choices

| Type                 | Example Systems            | Strengths                                             | Limitations                                   | When to Use                                     |
| -------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Relational (SQL)** | PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle  | Strong consistency, ACID, rich queries (SQL, joins)   | Harder to scale horizontally, schema rigidity | Banking, ERP, analytics with strong correctness |
| **Key-Value**        | Redis, DynamoDB, Riak      | Very fast lookups, simple model                       | No joins, limited query flexibility           | Caching, session stores, user profiles          |
| **Document**         | MongoDB, Couchbase         | Flexible schema, hierarchical docs                    | Joins are weak, eventual consistency common   | CMS, product catalogs, flexible JSON data       |
| **Columnar**         | Cassandra, HBase, Bigtable | Wide-column storage, great for writes and time series | Complex setup, weaker joins                   | Logging, time series, IoT data                  |
| **Graph**            | Neo4j, ArangoDB            | Optimized for relationships (edges)                   | Slower for non-graph workloads                | Social networks, recommendation engines         |

---

## 3. Core Database Concepts

### Indexing

- **B-Tree indexes:** balanced, efficient for range queries.
- **Hash indexes:** O(1) lookups but poor for ranges.
- **Covering indexes:** include all queried columns â†’ avoid table lookups.
- **Tradeoff:** faster reads but slower writes (maintaining index).

### Normalization vs Denormalization

- **Normalization:** reduce redundancy (3NF/BCNF), consistent updates, smaller storage.
- **Denormalization:** duplicate data for faster queries, common in OLAP/NoSQL.

### Scaling Approaches

- **Replication:** copies of data for HA/reads.
- **Sharding:** horizontal partitioning across servers.
- **Caching:** use Redis/Memcached to reduce DB load.
- **Event sourcing / CQRS:** separate read vs write models.

---

## 4. Patterns in System Design Interviews

- **Use SQL** when correctness, transactions, and structured queries matter.
- **Use NoSQL (KV/Doc/Column)** when availability, scale, and flexibility matter.
- **Mix approaches:** e.g., use PostgreSQL for core financial records, Redis for session caching, ElasticSearch for logs/queries.

| **Document**                          | **MongoDB (replica set)**                                 | **CP (tunable)**                                   | Flexible schema (JSON/BSON), rich queries & indexes                     | Cross-document transactions newer/limited by design                     | Content mgmt, product catalogs                          |
| **Wide-Column**                       | **Cassandra**                                             | **AP**                                             | Writes-first design, linear scalability, multi-DC friendly              | Eventual consistency; complex data modeling                             | Time-series, logging, large-scale writes                |
|                                       | **HBase / Bigtable**                                      | **CP**                                             | Strong consistency, huge tables, range scans                            | Operationally heavier; limited ad-hoc queries                           | Analytics backends, large KV/range workloads            |
| **Search**                            | Elasticsearch, OpenSearch                                 | **AP (tunable)**                                   | Full-text search, aggregations, near-real-time                          | Eventual consistency; not a primary source of truth                     | Search, logs, analytics                                 |
| **Graph**                             | Neo4j, ArangoDB                                           | **CA\*** (single-node) / **CP (cluster)**          | Efficient traversals, relationship-heavy queries                        | Not ideal for wide scans/OLAP                                           | Social graphs, recommendations                          |

\* **CA** is only meaningful when thereâ€™s effectively **no partition** (e.g., single-node or same-box). In real distributed settings you must pick between **CP** and **AP** under partitions.
**Tunable** = posture can be adjusted (e.g., quorum reads/writes, read/write concerns).

If you want, I can drop this directly into the Data Layer section and keep going with **indexing strategies, normalization vs. denormalization, replication vs. sharding, and caching**â€”all in the same reference style.

# Indexing Strategies

### What is an index?

A secondary data structure that lets the database find rows **without scanning the whole table**.

### Common Index Types

| Index              | Best For                                                | Notes                                                           |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **B-Tree**         | Range scans, ordering (`BETWEEN`, `<`, `>`, `ORDER BY`) | Default in most RDBMS; balanced tree keeps O(log n) lookups     |
| **Hash**           | Exact matches (`=`)                                     | No range scans; O(1) average lookups                            |
| **GIN / GIST**     | Full-text, arrays, geo                                  | Postgres: GIN for inverted (contains), GiST for spatial/nearest |
| **Bitmap**         | Low-cardinality columns                                 | Often used in data warehouses for analytics                     |
| **Covering Index** | Query can be answered by the index alone                | Add **included** columns so base table lookup is avoided        |

### General Rules

- Index **what you filter on**, not what you select.
- **Equality first**, then range: compound indexes should match query predicatesâ€™ order (e.g., `WHERE a = ? AND b = ? AND c > ?` â†’ index `(a, b, c)`).
- **High cardinality** columns benefit more (e.g., user_id > gender).
- Too many indexes **slow writes** (each insert/update must update indexes).

### SQL Snippets (PostgreSQL-flavored)

```sql
-- B-Tree (default)
CREATE INDEX idx_users_email ON users(email);

-- Composite index (equality, equality, then range)
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_user_date ON orders(user_id, status, created_at);

-- Partial index (only for active rows)
CREATE INDEX idx_active_users_email ON users(email) WHERE is_active = true;

-- Covering index (include extra columns)
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_lookup ON orders(order_id) INCLUDE (total_amount, status);

-- Full-text (GIN)
CREATE INDEX idx_docs_ft ON docs USING GIN (to_tsvector('english', body));
```

**Gotchas**

- **Leading column** matters in composite indexes. Query must use the leftmost parts to benefit.
- **Function indexes** require the query to use the same function (`LOWER(email)`).
- **Selectivity**: Indexes on low-selectivity columns (e.g., boolean) rarely help.

# Normalization vs Denormalization

### Normalization (3NF+)

- **Goal:** eliminate redundancy, maintain consistency.
- **Pros:** smaller data, consistent updates, fewer anomalies.
- **Cons:** more joins; sometimes slower reads.

### Denormalization

- **Goal:** speed reads by duplicating/aggregating data.
- **Pros:** fewer joins, faster read queries.
- **Cons:** write complexity; need **fan-out updates** or **background jobs** to keep in sync.

### When to Use

- **OLTP systems** (high write correctness): normalize first; denormalize selectively with materialized views/caches.
- **OLAP / analytics**: star/snowflake schemas, aggressive denormalization for read speed.

**Pattern**: Start normalized â†’ measure â†’ denormalize **targeted hot paths**.

---

# Replication vs Sharding

### Replication (Copy the same data to multiple nodes)

- **Synchronous:** writes wait for replicas â†’ **CP** flavor (lower availability if replicas unreachable, but consistent).
- **Asynchronous:** leader commits and returns â†’ **AP-ish** (stale reads possible).
- **Use for:** high availability (HA), read scaling (read replicas), DR.

**Terms**

- **Leader-Follower** (Primary-Replica)
- **Multi-leader** (conflict resolution needed)
- **Quorum** (R/W majority votes; tunable consistency)

**Example Read Scaling**

- Send writes to **leader**; send heavy reports to **read replicas**.

### Sharding (Horizontal partitioning; split data across nodes)

- **Key-based** (hash user_id) â†’ even distribution, but hard to do cross-shard joins.
- **Range-based** (by date/id range) â†’ easy range scans, risk hot shards.
- **Directory/Lookup** (custom routing service) â†’ flexible, operationally complex.

**When to Shard**

- Dataset wonâ€™t fit on a single node / vertical scaling exhausted.
- Single-node write throughput maxed out.

**Cross-shard Challenges**

- **Joins**: push down computations or pre-aggregate.
- **Transactions**: need 2PC/sagas; prefer **idempotent** operations.
- **Rebalancing**: plan for adding shards (consistent hashing helps).

---

# Caching (and Layers)

### Why Cache?

Reduce latency and database load by serving hot data from memory.

### Types of Caches

| Layer                 | Example                  | Pros                   | Cons                          |
| --------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Client-side**       | Browser cache            | Zero network hops      | Stale control limited         |
| **CDN/Edge**          | CloudFront, Fastly       | Global low-latency     | Purge/invalidation needed     |
| **Application cache** | In-process LRU           | Ultra fast             | Memory pressure; not shared   |
| **Distributed cache** | Redis, Memcached         | Shared across services | Network hop; consistency risk |
| **Database cache**    | Buffer pool, query cache | Transparent            | DB-specific behavior          |

### Caching Strategies

- **Cache-aside (lazy):** app reads cache, on miss load DB then write cache.

  - Simple; stale possible until TTL expires.

- **Write-through:** write to cache and DB simultaneously.

  - Safer reads; writes slower.

- **Write-back:** write to cache, flush to DB later.

  - Fast writes; risk data loss without durability.

- **Read-through:** cache sits in front of DB transparently.

  - Managed by cache layer/provider.

### Redis Patterns

```python
# Cache-aside (pseudo/Python)
value = redis.get(key)
if value is None:
    value = db.read(key)
    redis.setex(key, ttl_seconds, serialize(value))
return value
```

**Invalidation**

- TTLs on keys, **versioned keys** (`user:123:v42`) to avoid thundering herds.
- **Pub/Sub** or **streams** to broadcast invalidations on updates.

**Gotchas**

- **Stale reads** (eventual consistency).
- **Hot keys** (use sharding or probabilistic caching).
- **Stampede**: use **singleflight**/locks or **randomized TTL** to spread expiries.

# Putting It Together â€” Quick Decision Guide

- **Need strict correctness & joins?** Start with **PostgreSQL** (normalized).
- **Read-heavy & scale-out?** Add **read replicas** (async replication).
- **Global latency?** Add **CDN/edge** and regional **caches** (Redis).
- **Write throughput wall / dataset too large?** **Shard** by user or time.
- **Slow queries?** Add **indexes** (B-Tree for ranges; composite for equality+range; GIN for text/arrays).
- **Analytics?** Denormalize into **warehouse** (star schema) or use **columnar** stores.
