## Card 3

**Front:** Implement has_cycle using 🕸️ Graph Traversal Pattern

**Back:** ```python
# Detect cycle in directed graph
def has_cycle(graph):
    visited = set()
    rec_stack = set()
    
    def dfs(node):
        visited.add(node)
        rec_stack.add(node)
        
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                if dfs(neighbor):
                    return True
            elif neighbor in rec_stack:
                return True
        
        rec_stack.remove(node)
        return False
    
    for node in graph:
        if node not in visited:
            if dfs(node):
                return True
    return False
```
